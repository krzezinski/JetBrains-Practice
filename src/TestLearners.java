/*
 We need your help to improve an adaptive system. There's a program that asks learners
  what programming language they are learning. There are four options, one of them is correct:
    1. Java
    2. Kotlin
    3. Scala
    4. Python
 Your task: read the answerâ€™s number from the standard input and output the result of
  the test: "Yes!", "No!" or "Unknown number". We hope you know, which answer is correct.
  You don't need to print the question itself.

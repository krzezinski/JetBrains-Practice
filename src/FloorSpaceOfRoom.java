/*
 Residents of the country of Malevia often experiment with the plan of
   their rooms. Rooms can be triangular, rectangular, and round.
 Write a program that calculates the floorage of the rooms.
 Input data format:
   The type of the room shape and the relevant parameters.
 Output data format:
   The area of the resulting room.
 Note that the value of 3.14 is used instead of the number Ï€ in Malevia.
 Sample input : rectangle
                4
                10
        output: 40
